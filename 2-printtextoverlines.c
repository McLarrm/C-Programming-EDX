//We just showed you how to print text to the screen and in particular how to display multiple lines of text. In this activity, the goal is to print a list of skills you have already mastered to the screen.
//The list of skills is the following:

//I already know how to:
//- Print text to the screen.
//- Start a new line.
//- Fix errors.
#include <stdio.h>

/**
 * main - Print multiple lines.
 * 
 * Return: 0
 */
 int main(void)
